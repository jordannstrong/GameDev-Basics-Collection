Egg

Games (Design Changes):
Egg Drop: Added gold eggs, greens eggs, shiny eggs and rocks (see How To Play to learn what they do), as well as a multi-purpose spawner
to randomly spawn everything. Retextured the ground and hills.

Infinite Jumper: Replaced the default player model with a baby dragon and added the ability to swap between hats (for different effects)
or remove them altogether. Also adjusted the bottom boundary detection so that the player character can stand on platforms at the bottom
of the screen with "dying".

Marble Runner: Added new levels, A camera that can be rotated with the mouse (when enabled), moving platforms, a jump function, 
and new textures. Only one of the levels has a fixed-angle camera because the moving camera starts fighting the textures if a 
slope is in the way. When the mouse camera is enabled, rotating the camera re-orients the player controls so that the direction the
camera is facing is always "forward".
